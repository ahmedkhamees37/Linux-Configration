NFS_summary

*********************manual way*************************

################### AT server machine#######################

1-dnf install nfs-utils
 
2-systemctl enable --now nfs-server (at server only) 

3-check th firewall and allow the nfs serves
	- firewall-cmd --parmameny --add-serves=nfs
	- firewall-cmd --reload
	- firewall-cmd --list-all 

4-create the dir that i want to share 
	*mkdir /external (example)

5-to share the dir should add record in /etc/export --> (this file is related to nfs serves) 
	-  /external 192.168.2.132(rw)
		- /external (the dir path i want to share) 
		- 192.168.2.132(rw) ==> (it's the client ip i want to give him access) and (rw) is the option 

6-exportfs -r or exportfs -a for many files==> (this command the reload the export file to make nfs serves aware to changes in export file )

7- exportfs (to checkthe shared file)

8- exportfs -v (to list the default option like (rw) )


################### AT client machine ###################


1- to list the share dir for a specific server use 
	- showmount -e ip_of_server
	- this comman is use the rpc-bind serves and mountd in the server machine so us should ass them first 
		#firewall-cmd --parmanent --add-service=rpc-bind --add-service=mountd
		#firewall-cmd --reload
or 
2-  mount ip-of-server:/   /mnt

	###############first way to mount the share dir###########
1-mkdir  /mnt/external (create a dir used to mount)

2-  mount ip-of-server:/external (example)   /mnt/external

for permanent mount
1- open /etc/fstab
 
2- the add: ip-of-server:/external	/mnt/external  	nfs	defaults	0 0

	###############second way to mount the share dir (autofs)###########
In this way the file is Automount on demand and when i don't use to the dir is umount auto after 5 min (default value time)


		********** direct map ************** 
1- dnf install autonfs

2- create a file under /etc/auto.master.d/
	-touch (or vim) /etc/auto.master.d/(anyname).autofs
3- then vim or nano the file and write this ==> /shares  /etc/auto.demo	
	- (write inside /etc/auto.master.d/(anyname).autofs) ==> /- /etc/auto.direct   (auto.direct is a dir where i will write the mount details )
	-create the master map file   /etc/auto.direct using vim , this file contian the mount option details like (/external -rw,sync,fstype=fs4  ipofserver:/Path-Of-Share-dDir)  

4- systemctl enable --now autofs

5- if you use df -h to show the mount dir, you won't find it because by deafult it is umount until you use it for example echo "hello" > /externa/testing.txt then use df -h in this case you shile show the monut dir from nfs and after 5 min will disappear



		********** indirect map **************

1- dnf install autonfs

2- create a file under /etc/auto.master.d/
	-touch (or vim) /etc/auto.master.d/(anyname).autofs
3- then vim or nano the file and write this ==> /shares  /etc/auto.demo	
	- (write inside /etc/auto.master.d/(anyname).autofs) ==> /internal  /etc/auto.indirect  (/internal is the base dir where the autofs when auto mount a dir is mount it in internal and etc/auto.indirect is where i write my mount option like (rw) )
	- create the master map file   /etc/auto.indirect using vim , this file contian the mount option details in case of indirect the line start with * (* -rw,sync,fstype=f  ipofserver:/Path-Of-Share-dDir/&  (& is mean to mount the subdir under the path of dir i shared) )

4- systemctl enable --now autofs

5- if you use df -h to show the mount dir, you won't find it because by deafult it is umount until you use it for example echo "hello" > /externa/test/testing.txt then use df -h in this case you shile show the monut dir from nfs and after 5 min will disappear
